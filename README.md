# Xamarin Voice Recognition

This is a sample project to demonstrate the capabilities of voice recognition in **Xamarin Forms 2.3.4.224** using **.NET Standard 1.4**. This project was done specifically for [CodeCamp](http://codecamp.ro/), one of Romania' biggest IT events, on 8th April and 13th May 2017.

## DISCLAIMER

The code may not work properly now :sweat_smile: because it was done with technology prior to May 2017. I will update it as soon as I have some spare time but if you have it now and want to contribute => fork, pull request and I will have a look on it.

Other projects you may want to look into (also used in this demo):
 - [Plugin.BingSpeech](https://github.com/laurentiustamate94/bing-speech-library) - Bing Speech Plugin for Xamarin and Windows
 - [Plugin.NetStandardStorage](https://github.com/laurentiustamate94/netstandard-storage) - NetStandard Storage Plugin for Xamarin and Windows
